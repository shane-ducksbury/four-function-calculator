# Four Function Calculator
This repo is a four function calculator written in C++ as an Assignment. It is basic and probably buggy but was fun to build.

The calculator will run on Windows based machines running C++, it isn't compatible with C++ on Unix based systems as the assignment required it run on Windows, and I didn't have time to port it over.

I enjoyed learning to write code in C++, I find it more verbose to use than Java, but can see the value in a language like this. I will probably stick to Java for the moment as I prefer the way it handles packages, and I also can't see C++ being as well supported for building API and web backends, which I am more interested in. In future I would like to use C++ or similar to try my hand at Operating System level programming, maybe fixing some Linux bugs on an open source project.
